# nRF24L01_Wireless_Sensor_Dev_Board
This repository is for Arduino code that goes to an open source Wireless Sensor Development Board that is being developed on the ForceTronics YouTube channel. Please note that this code is still currently in early draft form. The Wireless Sensor Dev Board will feature an ATmega 328p MCU and a nRF24L01+ Transceiver Module. The 328p will be programmed using the Arduino IDE (Pro Mini 3.3V 8MHz bootloader). In the future this wireless sensor dev board will be available for sale at www.forcetronics.com
